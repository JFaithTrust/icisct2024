      Information for Presenters


      Oral Presentation Guidelines
      Presenters must be at the designated room of your session 15 minutes before it begins, so that you can meet your session chair and the other speakers in advance.

      It is most important to be within strict time constraints to allow the presentation to fit within the allotted time period. However, if needed, the session chairman will ensure that these time limits are strictly observed. Each paper has an estimated time slot of 15 to 20 minutes for presentation, and an additional 5 minutes for questions and answers.

      LCD projectors, as well as laptops, will be available in all oral presentation conference rooms. Other equipment will be provided at the presenter expenses if a request is being made. Please kindly forward any such request to the organizing chair of the conference, Prof. Dr. Guy Omidyar guy.omidyar@ieee.org

      Presenters should bring their compatible presentation files (PPS, PPT, PDF)stored in a USB storage device or a disc/CD/DVD. Presenters are kindly requested to upload their files into the laptop at least 15 minutes before the start of the session, if you do not bring your own laptop. Presenters are also kindly requested to test the functionality of the presentation before the beginning of the session.
